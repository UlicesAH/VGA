# VGA adapter
This is a simple PCB board for interfacing a FPGA with SIL header to a VGA connector to add video functionalities to your projects.

Please note that the VGA board showed in the next pictures is an older version and that's the reason there is a cable for connecting ground.
The new version has ground pins on both sides to avoid use cables (generally ground pins are at the begin/end of one SIL header in the development boards).
